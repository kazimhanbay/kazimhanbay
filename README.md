<h2>👨‍💻 &nbsp;Hi, I am Kazım</h2>

<p style="max-width: 300px; word-wrap: break-word;">
 I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Software Engineering at İnönü University. I received my B.S. degree in electronic-computer education from Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey, in 2004, and my Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from İnönü University, Malatya, in 2016.
My main research interests and projects include development of new computational models based on machine learning, image processing and computer vision. 

In last years, I have been working on different Tübitak and university projects that detect ships from SAR images.

Currently, my research group works on various image processing and machine learning problems such as remote sensing, fabric defect detection, synthetic aperture radar (ship detection and classificaiton).
